SetupMVC

Creating a Web app
    Open Visual Studio 2022/Visual Studio Code
    Create new ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and select next.
    Give the project a name and save location (Store the project solution and files in the same folder location).
    Select the .NET 6.0 framework.
    Select Create.

    Add a Model
        Right-Click on the models folder > Add > Class and name choose a name for the model. In this case it is Comment.cs
        Add NuGet packages: Select the tools menu > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.
        From here run the following:
            Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
            Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

        Add validation to a model
            The validation attributes specify behaviour that you want to enforce on the models' properties they’re applied to.
            Go to the Data folder > Report.cs
                E.g. Define validation attributes for StringLength of the Body object.
                        [Required]
                        [MaxLength(5000)]
                        public string? Body { get; set; }

     Add a controller to the ASP.NET Core MVC app
        Right click the controllers folder, select Add > New Scaffold Item
        Select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework > Add
        Select the model just created
        Select the + icon for adding a new Context, or
            Select the ApplicationDbContext
        Use default Controller Name > Add

    The previous step creates a Views folder and adds the default views for the controller.

    For all the changes above to take effect and create the Database, open the PMC (Package Manager Console) and type in the following commands:
        Add-Migration InitialMigration  # InitialMigration <- your migration's name
        Update-Database
    
    Repeat the process of adding models and controllers for the models to get every table that you require for the database context.

    Add a view
        Right click a folder from within Views and then Add > New Item.
        Use the search box (top right) to search for Razor View – Empty
        Keep the name box value, inde x.cshtml. and select Add.
 

Add Search to an ASP.NET Core MVC app
    The search functionality is found in the controllers and the views. The components work together to give the application this functionality.
        E.g. In the CommentsController, the logic within the Search() method will add the search functionality that is called upon from the 
             Index.cshtml view of the Views.Comments folder.
